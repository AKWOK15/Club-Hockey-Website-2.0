            In 2020, we received membership into the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA), and in 2021, we joined the Northeast Collegiate Hockey Association (NECHA), a division of the ACHA. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            We practice three times a week at Colbyâ€™s Jack Kelly Rink and play a schedule of 12 to 16 games. Our players have various hockey backgrounds ranging from introductory to prep school and junior hockey, but we welcome everyone regardless of skill level! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Our student leadership team runs all club operations, including game scheduling, budget allocation/distribution, and team events. Meanwhile, our coaching staff focuses on player development and team success.
